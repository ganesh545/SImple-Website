            <p class="sectionsubtag text-small">A bag (also known regionally as a sack) is a common tool in the form of
                a non-rigid container. The use of bags predates recorded history, with the earliest bags being no more
                than lengths of animal skin, cotton, or woven plant fibers, folded up at the edges and secured in that
                shape with strings of the same material.[1]

                Despite their simplicity, bags have been fundamental for the development of human civilization, as they
                allow people to easily collect loose materials such as berries or food grains, and to transport more
                items than could readily be carried in the hands.[1] The word probably has its origins in the Norse word
                baggi,[2] from the reconstructed Proto-Indo-European bʰak, but is also comparable to the Welsh baich
                (load, bundle), and the Greek Τσιαντουλίτσα (Chandulícha, load).

                Cheap disposable paper bags and plastic shopping bags are very common in the retail trade as a
                convenience for shoppers, and are often supplied by the shop for free or for a small fee. Customers may
                also take their own shopping bags to use in shops, these are more commonly known as tote bags or
                shoppers tote. Although, paper had been used for purposes of wrapping and padding in ancient China since
                the 2nd century BC,[3] the first use of paper bags (for preserving the flavor of tea) in China came
                during the later Tang Dynasty </p>

            <p class="sectionsubtag text-small">The history of sari-like clothing can be traced back to the Indus Valley
                Civilisation, which flourished during 2800–1800 BCE around the northwestern part of the Indian
                subcontinent.[4][5][6] Cotton was first cultivated and woven in the Indian subcontinent around the 5th
                millennium BCE.[19] Dyes used during this period are still in use, particularly indigo, lac, red madder
                and turmeric.[20] Silk was woven around 2450 BCE and 2000 BCE.[21][22]

                The word sari evolved from śāṭikā (Sanskrit: शाटिका) mentioned in earliest Hindu literature as women's
                attire.[23][15] The sari or śāṭikā evolved from a three-piece ensemble comprising the antarīya, the
                lower garment; the uttarīya; a veil worn over the shoulder or the head; and the stanapatta, a chest
                band. This ensemble is mentioned in Sanskrit literature and Buddhist Pali literature during the 6th
                century BCE.[24] This complete three-piece dress was known as poshak, a generic term for costume.[25]
                Ancient Antariya closely resembled the dhoti wrap in the "fishtail" version which was passed through
                legs, covered the legs loosely and then flowed into long, decorative pleats at front of the
                legs.[4][26][27] It further evolved into Bhairnivasani skirt, today known as ghagri and lehenga.[28]
                Uttariya was a shawl-like veil worn over the shoulder or head, it evolved into what is known today known
                as dupatta and ghoonghat.[29] Likewise, the stanapaṭṭa evolved into the choli by the 1st century CE.

            <p class="sectionsubtag text-small">A sewing machine is a machine used to sew fabric and materials together
                with thread. Sewing machines were invented during the first Industrial Revolution to decrease the amount
                of manual sewing work performed in clothing companies. Since the invention of the first sewing machine,
                generally considered to have been the work of Englishman Thomas Saint in 1790,[1] the sewing machine has
                greatly improved the efficiency and productivity of the clothing industry.

                Home sewing machines are designed for one person to sew individual items while using a single stitch
                type at a time. In a modern sewing machine, the process of stitching has been automated so that the
                fabric easily glides in and out of the machine without the inconvenience of needles, thimbles and other
                tools used in hand sewing. Early sewing machines were powered by either constantly turning a handle or
                with a foot-operated treadle mechanism. Electrically-powered machines were later introduced.

                Industrial sewing machines, by contrast to domestic machines, are larger, faster, and more varied in
                their size, cost, appearance, and task. </p>
